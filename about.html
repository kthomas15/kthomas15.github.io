       	  <h3>Get to Know Me</h3>
        	<p>Hi! Currently, I am a Senior Adverting and Public Relations student at UNL. I love going to school here, but I am SO excited to graduate and start up my career. Last summer, I had a wonderful experience as an intern at Kiewit in the Corporate Communications department. I was very sad when the summer came to an end, but I am fortunate that I had the opportunity and I can look forward to graduating.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Besides studying hard and working towards my future career, I have some other hobbies as well. I am a definitely a foodie and love trying new restaurants. Led Belly is my go-to restaurant here in Lincoln. As for Omaha, I enjoy J-CoCo, Dantes, Mula and Omaha Prime. I am open to any suggestions! A fun-fact about me is that in high school I was on a state championship winning tennis team. Go storm! Also, I am definitely a people-person. I love to hang out with my family and friends and to meet new people. </p>
            <br>
            <p>A goal I have for this year is to volunteer more. Giving back to the community is not only rewarding, but you can meet some great people in the process. I also want to improve on my graphic design and coding skills. I plan to accomplish these goals by the end the school year. Thank you for taking the time to read this, enjoy!</p>
